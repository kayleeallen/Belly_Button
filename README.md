# Belly_Button

### Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that analyzes data of bacteria from various subjects' belly buttons to discover bacteria that could potentially synthesize proteins that taste like beef. We used JavaScript, HTML, PlotLy, and JSON to complete the task.

My dashboard can be found here:  https://kayleeallen.github.io/Belly_Button/

You can use the "Test Subject ID No." filter on the left-hand corner of the page to filter through the various participants of the study.
